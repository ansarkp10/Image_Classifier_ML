**Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset**

Collect cat and dog images

Create two folders: cats/ and dogs/

Put cat images in cats/ folder

Put dog images in dogs/ folder

Aim for 100+ images each



**Step 2: Train Your Model**

Use a pre-trained model (faster)

Fine-tune it on your cat/dog images


**Step 3: Test Your Model**
Train for 10-20 rounds (epochs)

Save the trained model as .h5 file
